            <p>I’m a lifelong learner. I love learning and wroking with people and never stop trying. 
From recent projects during many courses in the university such as Software Engineering, Database system , 
Animation , OOP ,  and Web Programming, I worked with different group of people all along , 
</p>
<p>
though I aware about making mistakes, it is important to have courage to be a changer or admit 
what i don’t know, ask questions, foster the team to grow and finish the job together.</p>
<p>  
Communication, trust and support have always been crucial parts of my life. I’m a very team player type 
of person. Different perspective and opinions are considered as excitments to me which help me adapt faster,
understand better in the view that I may not experience like others. 
To be humble , understand yourself , and be kind doesn’t mean a weakness.</p>
<p>It is confident and strong to believe in oneself to be able to learn and grow up as an original, and real one.</p>
            <p>初めまして、ヤニザです。
私は自分とpodcastとたくさん仕方で一年ぐらい日本語を勉強します。
日本語と日本がすてきです、それで本当に綺麗な言葉遣いです。
そして私は頑張れです。
どうぞよろしくお願いいたします。
